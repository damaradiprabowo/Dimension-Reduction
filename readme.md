# Dimension reduction using PCA

Principal Component Analysis
(A more mathematical notebook with python and pyspark code is available the github repo)
Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is one of the most popular linear dimension reduction. Sometimes, it is used alone and sometimes as a starting solution for other dimension reduction methods. PCA is a projection based method which transforms the data by projecting it onto a set of orthogonal axes. It can be done with importing an PCA class by write  ``from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`` on the top of our code.
